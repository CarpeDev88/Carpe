# Carpe

**The counter-algorithm.**

Carpe is an Android-first experiment in technology that optimizes for the user's life instead of engagement.

## Prototype principles

- Useful with minimal permissions.
- Optional access is explicit and reversible.
- No infinite feed, ads, or engagement-maximizing streaks.
- Promote deliberate offline action: movement, cooking, meaningful work, saving, and intentional technology use.
- Measure success by attention returned to the user.

## Build

The GitHub Actions workflow builds a debug APK on every push to `main`. Open **Actions → Build Android APK → latest successful run → Artifacts** and download `carpe-debug-apk`.

Local build requires JDK 17 and Gradle 8.9:

```
gradle assembleDebug
```

APK output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## Status

v0.1 prototype. The Shield screen currently demonstrates permission architecture; OS-level interventions will be added incrementally and remain opt-in.
